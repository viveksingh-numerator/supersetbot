supersetbot is a utility bot that can be used to help around GitHub, CI and beyond.

The bot can be used as a local CLI OR, for a subset of fitted use cases, can be invoked directly
from GitHub comments.

Because it's its own npm app, it can be tested/deployed/used in isolation from the rest of
Superset, and take on some of the complexity from GitHub actions and onto a nifty
utility that can be used in different contexts.
